‚öôÔ∏è **Installation & Setup**

Get a local copy of GuardianEye up and running for development.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v16 or higher)
*   npm (v7 or higher)
*   MongoDB instance (local or cloud-based)

### Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/guardianeye.git
    cd guardianeye
    ```

2.  **Configure Backend Environment Variables:**
    In the `server/` directory, create a `.env` file. You will need to add your MongoDB connection string and a secret for signing JWTs.
    ```bash
    # server/.env
    MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_key
    ```

3.  **Configure Frontend Environment Variables:**
    In the root project directory, create a `.env` file to tell the frontend where to find the backend API.
    ```bash
    # .env
    VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
    ```

4.  **Install Dependencies:**
    This project has separate dependencies for the frontend and backend. Open two terminal windows to install them.
    ```bash
    # In your first terminal (project root):
    npm install
    ```
    ```bash
    # In your second terminal (server directory):
    cd server
    npm install
    ```

5.  **Run the Application:**
    You need to run both the frontend and backend servers concurrently in their respective terminals.
    ```bash
    # In your first terminal (project root):
    npm run dev
    ```
    ```bash
    # In your second terminal (server directory):
    npm run dev
    ```

    *   The React frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.
    *   The Node.js backend will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.
